### Excerpts from Naval Ravikant tweets

A Few days earlier, I came to know about this person **Naval Ravikant.** I listened to his podcasts, watched videos explaining and decoding his tweets and his interviews on YouTube. I am really impressed with his thinking process and found this person very inspiring. Noting down a few of the lessons learned from all these resources.

1. **Wealth** is anything that continues to **give you recurring income even without your effort and time.** Example: real state, gold, stocks, angel investment

2. **Money** is the way using which you **buy or spend time.**

3. Most of the money that you earn should go into savings. One should be content with their lifestyle and their expenses should not have a **linear** relationship with the income.

4. Invest in the things that will be there forever.

5. <i>"Pick an industry where you can play long-term games with long-term people".</i>

6. Never create anything for that 5\% of pessimistic people, who exist only to complain with the loudest noise, trying their best to break off your reach to the remaining 95\%, who are there to support and uplift you.

7. <i>"The joy of failure is YOURS. Why are you giving this chance to OTHERS?"</i>

8. <i>"If you have **specific knowledge**, then it would be hard for others to replace you." </i>

    ```Specific Knowledge: The thing that the world needs, but people of the world do not know that they need.```

9. Think about this: <i>"What is your **IKIGAI**? What is your accountability?"</i>

10. Learn to let go of things. **Pick your Battle**.

11. How you do any work is way more important because only working hard does not guarantee you success. So, stop grazing like cows all day, and learn to hunt like a lion. 

12. You will never be rich working for others and renting out your time. You need to own your business or equity.

13. Learn the power to be alone and enjoy.

14. <i>"It is easier to change yourself than to change others".</i>

15. **Retirement:** When you stop sacrificing today for some imaginary tomorrow.

16. Your real resume is the catalog of your sufferings. On your deathbed, you will remember all your hard works and sacrifices, instead of the things that you got easily.

17. Life is always a single-player game. The world always reflects back your feelings to you.

18. If you want to let go of anything, always think positive or happy thoughts because these thoughts are the easiest one to forget or let go. But, the negative thoughts tend to linger and stay for a longer period.

19. Pick an aspirational hourly rate for yourself and always value your time.
