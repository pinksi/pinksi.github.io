You want to write a thousand pages of a book, you have billions and zillions things to write, and you take your pen and notebook or your laptop, **Oops,** you suddenly become out of the words. Then you sit down and start to think, what you were thinking to write, and how you ended up here.

On some random moment, out of nowhere an idea strikes in your mind. For you, this freshly brewed idea seems to be extraordinary and is capable of bringing some revolutionary changes. You think about pitching this million dollar idea among your small bunch of buddies and dream about a big round of applause from them. Thinking all these things makes you ecstatic, your heart starts to jump with joy, your mind starts singing and your feet start dancing. An eternity later, you come to your sense, collect your calm and think about noting it down, but when you are ready with paper and pen, **Alas** you are out of the words. You try your best to think what was the idea, but slowly you not only remember the idea but numerous loopholes along with them. Now billions and zillions of problems also with their so-called perfect solutions start to dance in your mind. Then you realize it was just like a honeymoon phase of a relationship, full of exuberance, but after it gets over, you are back to the reality. You brainstorm as much as you can and then you left those thoughts arguing, fighting and finally killing each other. Then you stay there clueless, trying to figure out what just happened.

> **I have been through this kind of situation almost all the time. Have you ever faced such a situation?**

If yes, congrats, you are the same stupid person as I am(stupid in a good way). Welcome to our little stupid world and cheers to our stupidity. Sometimes finding another stupid person as you are, seems like a big deal of joy. This kind of situation makes me think that I am clumsy, OK, a bit of weird as well. But not treating this weirdness as weirdness is what I do.

> **What you can do about it?**

Irrespective of all the weirdness wired within us, I think the greatest thing we can do is accept ourselves. So accept yourself and be happy with yourself. It is that simple.

<i>I have some kind of weird habits. I think all of the people have something weird about themselves. This is second habit that I find weird. If you want to know what is the first one, you can find it [here](https://pinksi.github.io/2016/10/03/habits/). I will keep updating this series, once I encounter such weird habits in future. :D </i>
