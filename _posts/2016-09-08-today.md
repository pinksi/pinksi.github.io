Today was a hectic day,<br>
so hectic that,<br>
sometimes, my confidence dwindled,<br>
my heart trembled,<br>
I felt as if<br>
I was the only one doing so many mistakes<br>
and always covering them up.<br>

Today was messy day,<br>
so messy that,<br>
sometimes, my mind filled with all those negative thoughts,<br>
my body full with dirt,<br>
and the whole environment looked more messier.<br>

Today was a painful day,<br>
so painful that,<br>
sometimes, I questioned on my existence,<br>
I fought with my emotions,<br>
and wished as if I could finish up my life.<br>

Today was a tearful day,<br>
so tearful that,<br>
sometimes, I threw all our belongings,<br>
teared out all those pretty letters,<br>
and forced myself to forget all those moments.<br>

My eyes were raining,<br>
sometimes, with thundering,<br>
and sometimes, bringing out the floods,<br>
letting the little pillow completely get drenched.<br>
