I"l<p>Today was a hectic day,<br />
so hectic that,<br />
sometimes, my confidence dwindled,<br />
my heart trembled,<br />
I felt as if<br />
I was the only one doing so many mistakes<br />
and always covering them up.<br /></p>

<p>Today was messy day,<br />
so messy that,<br />
sometimes, my mind filled with all those negative thoughts,<br />
my body full with dirt,<br />
and the whole environment looked more messier.<br /></p>

<p>Today was a painful day,<br />
so painful that,<br />
sometimes, I questioned on my existence,<br />
I fought with my emotions,<br />
and wished as if I could finish up my life.<br /></p>

<p>Today was a tearful day,<br />
so tearful that,<br />
sometimes, I threw all our belongings,<br />
teared out all those pretty letters,<br />
and forced myself to forget all those moments.<br /></p>

<p>My eyes were raining,<br />
sometimes, with thundering,<br />
and sometimes, bringing out the floods,<br />
letting the little pillow completely get drenched.<br /></p>
