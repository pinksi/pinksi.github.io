Hi, I am Pinky, a bit clumsy but happy in my heart :D. 

- I am a **Software Engineer**, graduated with a degree in computer engineering from Tribhuvan University, **[IOE, Pulchowk Campus](http://doece.pcampus.edu.np)** in 2017.
- I am currently working as a Data Scientist at **[Docsumo](https://docsumo.com/)**.
- My primary interests lie in the field of **machine learning and computer vision**. I am very interested to work on projects related to information retrieval, data mining, classification and different applications related to CV and NLP.
- Here are my **two research** publication published in **IEEE**, from my engineering career. I am really looking forward to do more impactful research and publish them in different AI conferences.

    1. **[Real-Time Stock Prediction Using Neural Network](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8443057)**
    2. **[A Comparison of Semantic Similarity Methods for Maximum Human Interpretability](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8947433)**

    Also want to do some international traveling within these years. So, let's see what life has hold for me.

- I am planning to share bits and pieces of my travel in form of photos or blog post. If you are interested to know about my journey, you can follow me <b>[here](https://www.instagram.com/aloo_travellers/)</b>.

- I like to read fictional novels and short stories (choose mostly books with happy ending :D). Nowadays, I am trying to form a habit of reading non-fiction and self help books as well.
