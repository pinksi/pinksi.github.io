Hi, I am Pinky, a bit clumsy but happy in my heart :D. 

- I am a **Computer Engineer**, graduated with a degree in computer engineering from Tribhuvan University, **[IOE, Pulchowk Campus](http://doece.pcampus.edu.np)** in 2017.
- I am currently working as a Data Scientist at **[Docsumo](https://docsumo.com/)**.
- My primary interests lie in the field of **machine learning and computer vision**. I am very interested to work on projects related to information retrieval, data mining, classification and different applications related to CV and NLP.
- Here are my **two research** publication published in **IEEE**, from my engineering career. I am really looking forward to do more impactful research and publish them in different AI conferences.

    1. **[Real-Time Stock Prediction Using Neural Network](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8443057)**
    2. **[A Comparison of Semantic Similarity Methods for Maximum Human Interpretability](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8947433)**

<!-- Hobbies -->
- Traveling has been ingrained in me from my childhood. I mostly prefer trekking and here are the few of the wonderful places of Nepal, I have been to:
        
    1. Mardi Base Camp
    2. Annapurna Circuit
    3. Annapurna Base Camp
    4. Poonhill
    5. Gosainkunda 

    <!-- I am planning to write my travel stories of the places I have been to here as well. Here you can follow me if you like to see my travel journey: [insta link] -->

    Here are the list of the places that I am looking forward to reach before turning 30.
        
    1. Everest base camp & Gokyo Lake
    2. Langtang Trek
    3. Shey Phoksundo & Dolpo Circuit Trek

    Also want to do some international traveling within these years. So, let's see what life has hold for me.

- I like to read fictional novels and short stories (choose mostly books with happy ending :D). Nowadays, I am trying to form a habit of reading non-fiction and self help books as well.
