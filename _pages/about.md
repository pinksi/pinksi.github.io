Hi, I am Pinky, a bit clumsy but happy in my heart :D. 

- I am a **Software Engineer**, graduated with a degree in computer engineering from Tribhuvan University, **[IOE, Pulchowk Campus](http://doece.pcampus.edu.np)** in 2017.
- I am currently working as a Data Scientist at **[Docsumo](https://docsumo.com/)**.
- My primary interests lie in the field of **machine learning and computer vision**. I am very interested to work on projects related to information retrieval, data mining, classification and different applications related to CV and NLP.
- Here are my **two research** publications published in **IEEE**, from my engineering career. I am really looking forward to doing more impactful research and publishing them in different AI conferences.

    1. **[Real-Time Stock Prediction Using Neural Network](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8443057)**
    2. **[A Comparison of Semantic Similarity Methods for Maximum Human Interpretability](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8947433)**

    Also want to do some international traveling within these years. So, let's see what life has held for me.

- I am planning to share bits and pieces of my travel in the form of photos or blog posts. If you are interested to know about my travel journey, you can follow me @<b>[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/aloo_travellers/)</b> and @[here](https://aloo-travellers.netlify.app/) is my blog, where I will be writing about all my travel memories, stories, itineraries and information that I have.

- I like to read fictional novels and short stories (choose mostly books with happy a ending :D). Nowadays, I am trying to form a habit of reading non-fiction and self help books as well.
