MS Student, University of Louisiana at Lafayette

### Education
I have started my Masters in Informatics in School of Computing and Informatics at <ins>[University of Louisiana at Lafayette](https://computing.louisiana.edu/){:target="_blank"}</ins> from Fall 2021. 

I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering from Tribhuvan University, <ins>[Institute of Engineering](http://doece.pcampus.edu.np){:target="_blank"}</ins> in Nepal in 2017. 

### Research Interests
My research interests lies in the areas of data science and machine learning. I am interested in information extraction from documents using NLP, Computer Vision and Machine learning.
