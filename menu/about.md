title: Get to know me!
---

I am a computer science graduate with a degree in computer engineering from Tribhuvan University, Institute of       Engineering, <a href="http://doece.pcampus.edu.np/" target="_blank">Pulchowk Campus</a> in Nepal. My undergraduate thesis <a href="https://github.com/pinksi/Project-Report" target="_blank">"Stock Market Analysis and Prediction"</a> was supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZB6i0OKaPo4C&hl=en" target="_blank">Prof. Dr. Subarna     Shakya</a>.

My primary interests lie in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). I am interested to work on projects related to information retrieval, data mining, classification and different applications related to CV and NLP.

My hobbies includes traveling and reading novels. I love to be in lost within nature and prefer trekkings. Sometimes I scribble my random thoughts in words. You can read few of my writings from <a href="https://medium.com/@pinky.sitikhu524" target="_blank">here.</a>
